There is a flower within my heart
Daisy, daisy
Planted one day by a glancing dart
Planted by Daisy Bell

Whether she loves me or loves me not
Sometimes it's hard to tell
Yet I am longing to share the lot
Of beautiful Daisy Bell

Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

We will go tandem as man and wife
Daisy, Daisy
Pe'ling away down the road of life
I and my Daisy Bell

When the night's dark, we can both despise
P'liceman and lamps as well
There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes
Of beautiful Daisy Bell

Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
